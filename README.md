Part focused on Data Analysis, integrating our bank with AI.

---

### First step:
- migrate my historical data from an On-premise Database to a Cloud Database (AWS);
- migration of other data (ETL pipeline) to the new database;
- we will use pandas lib:
    - read_sql() method;
    - to_sql() method;

### Second step:
- perform a statistical analysis of the data;

### Third step:
- we will analyze the data using AI Gen;
- to do this, we will build a connection between our DataBase data and the ChatGPT API and perform analysis;
- with this connection, we will make a request from the OpenAI API with our gold dataset;

### Fourth step:
- create a PowerPoint with the IA Gen analysis;
- we will use gamma app (https://gamma.app/create)
